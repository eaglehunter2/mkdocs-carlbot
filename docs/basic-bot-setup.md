# Basic bot setup

!!! info
    This is much easier done on the website at [https://carl.gg](https://carl.gg)

This guide will cover everything you need to do to get started with everything carlbot offers.

### 1. Setting up the prefix

I want the bot to respond when I use the prefix `-` to do that, I can type `!prefix set -`. Carlbot offers up to 15 prefixes at once, so I could also add a second prefix by typing `!prefix add .`
