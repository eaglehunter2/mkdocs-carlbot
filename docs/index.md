# Basic bot setup

### 1. Basic Setup

â€¢ To do a basic bot setup, you'll require only a few things..
  â—‹ Just run `*report <@user> <reason>` and bot will create a channel `#reports` which must be private (because we won't update reports channel's perms ðŸ˜”)
  
### 2. Commands
â€¢ `invite` - Sends you an invite link loaded with perms to your server. <br>
  â—‹ Note: We need these perms in order to function properly! <br>
  â–º `MANAGE_CHANNEL` - This perm is required in order to function `/channelcreate` command. <br>
  â–º `CHANGE_NICKNAMES` and `MANAGE_NICKNAMES` - This perm is required in order to function `*afk [status]` command. <br>
  â–º `
â€¢ `yt <search>`, `google <search>`, `slap <@mention>`, `whois <@mention>`, `afk [status]`, `re`, `emoji <search>`, `jokes`, `report <@mention> <reason>`, `ping`, `thank <@mention> <reason>`, `discordfact`, `8ball <question>(don't believe such answer(s)!
